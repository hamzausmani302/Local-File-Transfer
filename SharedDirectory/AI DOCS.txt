Question 1
_______________________
1.
Artificial Intelligence is the development and theoritical understanding of computer systems which can perform tasks which normally
require human intelligence. Yes, I do agree because Speech recognition and prediction systems have known to be perfomed even better than
human themselves like chess AI which defeated the renowned world Champion.

2.
Self driving cars by Tesla are examples of AI which has bring a revolution in automobile sector in the recent years.

3.
Everything that has been done till now in the field of AI is the practice of replicating human brain itself through program so it can
take certain decisions based on the inputs from the environment. It has already surpassed human brain in some areas like gamimg industry 
but AI shouldn't be replicated to that extent which may cause potential risk on human lives like introducing emotional intelligence may cause
the AI robots to take negative actions.

4.
Despite exceptional results, AI has faced numerous criticism in the recent years which were a result of certain failures in AI applications.
Accidents of self driving cars which failed to make any proper decison when a truck was in front and crashed into it risking human lives.
Medical is a very sensitive sector so introducing AI may cause it to take ultimate decisons but even a slightest mis-learning can lead to 
a very serious matter but still there are few cases where AI has reportedly malfunctioned as it is a machine , it is still unable to reach the 
potential of human brain.

5.
Reasoning in AI refers to the logical process of making decisions based on an input with the help of existing knowledge. Logic is the 
representation of knowledge of the agent world , environment etc while ontalogy is a shared vocabulary for researchers to represent 
knowledge around Machine learning disciple.

6.
Machine learning allows a computer to learn from data by identifying patterns in the data and to identify these patterns
it uses  statistics and probability to classify, predict ,recommend and make decisions based on the pattern. e.g linear regression etc.
Similarly probability allows the computer to make certain predictions and take decisons after learning from the input data then predicting 
external data.

7.
AI has been a field of major research in the past years. Self driving cars, smart appliances, artificial intelligence robots,
emotional intelligence , computer vision. Work has been done in these areas but still they are still yet to be explored. Machine learning in
cybersecurity to allow the system to defend itself from cyber attacks.

Question 2 
_____________________

applcation :- Automated taxi driver

Environment type : Partially observable(it donot have 360 degree coverage of environment eg.road),
stochastic(Never predict the behavior of environment), 
Sequential (it needs to remember previous actions to take further decisions) , 
dynamic(changing environment) ,   
Singgle Agent environment(only one agent driver here)
Agent type : Goal baseed Agents(it has a certain goal to reach its destination)

Performance Measure:  Safe,Reliable,Efficient,Friendly,Provide comfor
Environment: Roads , Other Vehicles ,Customers , Pulls , Brideges
Actuators: Steering Wheel, Brakes , Horn , 
Sensors:Camera , Speedometer , car monitoring sensors

Question 3 
______________________

Blind search is a searching techniques where the algorithm donot know where 
the goal exists or whether it exists or not. It just brute force to find the
goal whether it is presnt of not.
DFS and BFS are examples of Blind search
where DFS uses LIFO stack and BFS uses BFS queue data structure.

Question 4 
______________________

queue = Queue();
func DepthSearch(root , node , depth):
	found = False;
	while(!queue.isempty())
		if(root.depth >= depth)
			
		elif(root == node)
			found  =  True;
			break;
		else:
			for child in root.adj:
				queue.push(child);
			
		root = queue.pop();	
	return found;
func Iterative_Deepening_Depth(graph, node , maxdepth)
	for i in (1..maxdepth):
		result = DepthSearch(graph.root , node ,i);			
		if(result == True)
		 is 	return "Found";
	return "Not Found"





_________________________

Question 5
_________________________

Algorithms have information about the goal state which makes searching process more efficient.
This information is obtained thorugh heuitistic.
Heuristic is a function which allows the algorithm to get information about an object. 
e.g PACMAN GAME where the distance between enemy and player is calculated by the AI player.

Question 6
_________________________

Initially 
STEP 1:
	Visited = []
	Queue = [S]
STEP 2 : Pop S  push childrens in priority irder
	Visited =[S]
	Queue = [A,B,C,D]	//5 9 6 6
STEP 3 : POP A PUSH ITS CHILDREN	{lowest cost}
	Visited = [S,A]
	Queue = [G1,B,C,D]	//9 9 6 6
STEP 4 : Pop C PUSH CHILDRENS
	Visited = [S,A,C]
	Queue = [G2,F,G1,B,D]	//5 7 9 9 6
STEP 5 : Pop G2 no hcildrens
	Visited = [S,A,C,G2]	//found GOAL 2
	Queue = {F,G1,B,D}	//7 9 9 6
STEP 6 : Pop D and push childrens
	Visited = [S,A,C,G2,D]
	Queue = [F,G1,B,E]	  //7 9 9 2		//C already visited so not pushed
STEP 7 : Pop E and push childrens
	Visited = [S,A,C,G2,D,E]
	Queue = [G3,F,G1,B]	//7 7 9 9
STEP 8 : Pop G3 
	Visited = [S,A,C,G2,D,E,G3]
	Queue = [F,G1,B]	//7 9 9
STEP 9 : Pop F and add children {D already visited}
	Visited = [S,A,C,G2,D,E,G3]
	Queue = [G1,B]	//9 9 
STEP 10 : Pop G1
	Visited =[S,A,C,G2,D,E,G3,G1];
	Queue = [B]	// 9
STEP 11 : Pop B {A and C visited}
	Visited =[S,A,C,G2,D,E,G3,G1,B];
	Queue = []	//Queue is now empty stop

STEP 12 : STOP
